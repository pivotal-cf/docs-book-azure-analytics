## How To Use Bookbinder To View Your Documentation

[Bookbinder](https://github.com/pivotal-cf/bookbinder/blob/master/README.md) is a command-line
utility for stitching Markdown documents into a hostable web app. The documentation team uses
Bookbinder to publish our documentation sites, but you can also use Bookbinder to view a live
version of your documentation on your local machine.

Bookbinder draws the content for the site from this repository, the left navigation menu ("subnav")
from [docs-book-azure-analytics](https://github.com/pivotal-cf/docs-book-azure-analytics), and various layout
configuration and assets from [docs-layout-repo](https://github.com/pivotal-cf/docs-layout-repo).

To use Bookbinder to view your documentation, perform the following steps:

1. Clone this repository to the `~/workspace` directory on your local machine.
1. Clone the [docs-azure-analytics](https://github.com/pivotal-cf/docs-azure-analytics) and
[docs-layout-repo](https://github.com/pivotal-cf/docs-layout-repo) repositories to the `~/workspace` directory on your
local machine.
1. Navigate into the `docs-book-azure-analytics` directory.
1. Run `bundle install` to install all of the necessary gems, including Bookbinder.
1. Run `bundle exec bookbinder bind local` to build a Rack web-app of the book. After the bind has completed, navigate
into the `final_app` directory and run `rackup`. Then navigate to `localhost:9292/azure-log-analytics-nozzle/index.html` in a
browser.

## Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery

We use Concourse pipelines to provide continuous integration and continuous delivery. Any change made to this repository
or the [https://github.com/pivotal-cf/docs-azure-analytics] content repository trigger a "bind" where the disparate parts of
the Nozzle for VMware Tanzu for Microsoft Azure Log Analytics documentation are assembled into a single web app. A successful bind triggers pushing the app to the
staging site,
[https://docs-pcf-staging.cfapps.io/azure-log-analytics-nozzle](http://docs-pcf-staging.cfapps.io/azure-log-analytics-nozzle). After
review, the staging site is manually pushed to the production site,
[https://docs.pivotal.io/azure-log-analytics-nozzle/](https://docs.pivotal.io/azure-log-analytics-nozzle/).
